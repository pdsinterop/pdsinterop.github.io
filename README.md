# PDS Interop

> _"Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves."_

**PDS Interop** stands for **P**ersonal **D**ata **S**tores **Interop**erability.

We are an open-source, grant and sponsorship driven collaboration, intent on 
bringing interoperability between personal data stores to the masses.

Our first main mission was to bring [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) to
[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) by creating an open source Nextcloud app that
turns a Nextcloud server into a spec-compliant Solid server.

We are also working on providing [test suites](https://pdsinterop.org/test-suites/) for PDS Interop,
and documenting [conventions](https://pdsinterop.org/conventions/) used by apps and services that store data
interoperably on your PDS.

**PDS Interop** stands for **P**ersonal **D**ata **S**tores **Interop**erability.

We are an open-source, grant and sponsorship driven collaboration, intent on 
bringing interoperability between personal data stores to the masses.

Our current mission is to bring [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) to
[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) by creating an open source Nextcloud app that
turns a Nextcloud server into a spec-compliant Solid server.
